            While most terms and conditions use similar language, many clauses are highly specific to the site for which they are created. Therefore, you can’t just copy terms and conditions text from another site and expect it to work for your site.

            Secondly, you may end up with an incomplete terms and conditions agreement if you just copy it from another site. Unfortunately, many sites — especially smaller ones — have incomplete or plagiarized terms and conditions that don’t sufficiently insulate them from legal and financial risks.

            What’s more, copying another site’s terms and conditions may also land you in legal trouble for plagiarism. This is particularly true if you copy your terms and conditions from a reputable company.
